"""Evaluation -- PLAN.md Phase 4 exit and §7.

Everything here is **seat-swapped on paired seeds**: each deal is played twice,
once with the network on each side. Without that, a win rate is contaminated by
whatever first-player edge the position has (measured: random-vs-random sits at
50.0% only because it is paired this way, and the first player wins 53.7% of
random games), and by which side happened to be dealt the better opening.

The opponents are the Phase 2 baselines, unchanged, so Phase 4's numbers are
directly comparable to the ones the engine was validated with.

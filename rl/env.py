"""The environment -- PLAN.md Phase 3, §5.1.

**Not Gymnasium.** Gymnasium is single-agent, and this game is two-player with
alternating priority and a variable-length action list that fits no standard
`Space`. This is a plain class with a PettingZoo-AEC *shape*: one seat is to
move at a time, `step` advances until somebody has a real decision, and the
observation always belongs to whoever that is.

Two API decisions are deliberate and both exist to prevent specific bugs.

**`step` takes an index, not an action.** The policy picks a slot in the list
the env just handed it. That is what makes a variable-length action space
trainable at all (§5.1), and it means an off-by-one in the mask is impossible
to express rather than merely unlikely.

**Rewards are per seat, always both.** `StepResult.rewards[s]` is seat `s`'s
reward -- never "the reward for whoever just moved". The classic self-play bug
is crediting the final actor for the win (§5.3 gotcha 1), and it is a bug you
cannot write against this signature. The trainer keeps one buffer per seat and
writes both entries at game end.

**Auto-pass** collapses priority windows where `pass` is the only legal action.
Those are not decisions, and in v0 (no `[Reaction]` cards yet) every Showdown
window is one, which is most of the step count. The guard is strict and stays
strict: the list must be *literally* `[pass]`. The moment a Reaction is
affordable the window becomes a real decision -- and those windows are exactly
where bluffing lives (§5.3 gotcha 3), so auto-passing one would delete the
phenomenon this project is being built to study.

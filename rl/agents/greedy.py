"""A greedy heuristic baseline (PLAN.md Phase 2).

Deliberately shallow -- this exists to prove the engine rewards sane play, not
to play well. If it does not crush a random agent, either the engine is wrong or
the heuristic is, and finding that out here is far cheaper than finding it out
after a training run.

Priority order, and why:

  1. **Attack only when the maths says you wipe them.** Because attackers are
     Recalled if any defender survives (466.1.a.2), a failed attack achieves
     *nothing at all* -- no chip damage, no ground. So the bar is not "I win the
     fight", it is "my pool kills every defender".
  2. **Otherwise develop**, biggest body first, and never retreat.

The attack test is exact rather than heuristic, because with vanilla units the
outcome is a closed-form function of summed Might (see `combat.py`).

**This used to open with "play a unit onto an empty Battlefield -- free points,
an immediate Conquer with no Showdown to lose."** That line described an engine
bug, not the game: 806.3 restricts playing units to your base or a battlefield
you already **control**, so the free Conquer never existed. When the engine was
corrected the heuristic did not merely become useless, it became actively
harmful -- its filter looked for battlefields `bf_ctrl != seat`, which the
action list can no longer contain, so every unit fell through to the "stay
home" branch and greedy stopped garrisoning anything at all. A heuristic that
silently turns into a no-op is worse than one that is wrong out loud, which is
why the reasoning is written down here rather than left implicit in a filter.
Found by the project owner reading this file.

Deployment is now: **reinforce a battlefield we control whose garrison the
opponent could currently wipe**, otherwise stay at base where the unit keeps
its options. The test has to be about our garrison's survival, not about enemy
presence -- in a Neutral Open State we can never be sharing a battlefield,
because a unit arriving where the enemy stands stages a Combat that the next
Cleanup initiates. And greedy pays
[Accelerate] when it is playing to base, because a unit that enters ready can
join an attack this turn while an exhausted one cannot act until the next --
worth one rune of attrition to a shallow baseline. It does not accelerate a
unit it is parking on a battlefield, where readiness buys only a retreat.

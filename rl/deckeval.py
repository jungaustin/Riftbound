"""Deck evaluation -- the §1.1/§1.2 deliverable.

    python3 rl/deckeval.py --ckpt rl/runs/fp/best.pt --a decks/... --b decks/...
    python3 rl/deckeval.py --ckpt ... --round-robin --top 6

Two numbers, and they answer different questions:

**Head-to-head win rate.** Play the matchup many times with the same policy on
both sides, seats swapped on paired seeds. This is the number that means "deck A
beats deck B", and pairing matters more here than anywhere else in the project:
going first is worth ~14 points at victory 3 (measured), so an unpaired result
is mostly a coin-flip about who was dealt seat 0.

**The critic's V(s0).** With `gamma = 1.0` and terminal-only reward the value
head is a literal win-probability predictor, so its opinion of the opening
position *is* a deck rating -- available without playing a single game. That is
the deliverable the whole architecture was pointed at (§1.2).

Reporting both is deliberate: V(s0) is fast and comparable across many decks,
the win rate is slow and true, and **the gap between them is the interesting
diagnostic**. A critic that rates a deck highly and then loses with it has
learned something about positions that does not survive contact with play.

**Every result carries its deck coverage.** At 50% coverage the engine is
playing a proxy built by substituting unimplemented cards, so the number
describes the proxy. `DeckLoad.coverage` travels with the result for exactly
that reason, and `--min-coverage` refuses decks below a threshold.

"""Observation encoding -- PLAN.md §5.2.

Three rules, in priority order.

**1. The viewer is the spec.** `viewer.view(state, table, cfg, seat)` defines
what a seat may legitimately see. This module encodes that and nothing more:
own hand, both trashes as counts, deck and opponent-hand counts but never
contents, and the Facedown Zone as a public slot with a private card (107.3.f).
`privileged` is the one deliberate exception -- it is critic-only and training-
only (asymmetric actor-critic, §6.4), and it is a separate field precisely so
that "did this leak?" is answerable by looking at which field a number is in.

**2. Canonicalize.** Everything is encoded from the acting seat's point of view:
"mine" and "theirs", "own base" and "enemy base", never "seat 0" and "seat 1".
One network then serves both seats. `rl/engine/mirror.py` exists to test this.

**3. Attributes, never card ids.** A card is its stat line, type, domains and
keywords. No id one-hots, so a card the net never saw in training still gets a
sensible embedding from its features -- which is the entire reason this can
become a deck evaluator rather than a bot for one decklist (§1.1).

Battlefields are *not* mirrored between seats: both are public ground and are
told apart by their card features, not by whose they are.

# Both derived from the engine's own caps for the same reason, twice learned:
# `HAND_SLOTS` was 16 ("spells draw cards; 12 was reachable") and real decks
# reached 23. Tracking `MAX_HAND` is the one value that cannot be outgrown
# without the engine itself refusing the state first.
HAND_SLOTS = MAX_HAND
# **Derived, not chosen.** This was 24, picked as "far above anything a legal
# game reaches" -- and then 806.3 landed, games got ~3x longer, and boards of 31
# live permanents appeared in ordinary random play. A hand-tuned headroom
# constant has to be re-tuned every time the game changes and only announces
# itself by crashing mid-run. `MAX_PERMS` is the engine's own hard cap, so
# tracking it is the one value that cannot be outgrown.
BOARD_SLOTS = MAX_PERMS

# The Chain, top-first. **Not** `MAX_CHAIN`, which is 152 -- that is the
# engine's structural ceiling (2*MAX_HAND + MAX_TRIGGERS), not a depth any game
# reaches, and a 152-row dense zone in every observation would cost more than
# everything else here combined. Measured over 56k decisions in 400 real-deck
# games the deepest Chain was 9.
#
# So unlike `hand` and `board`, overflow here is NOT a bug and must not assert:
# rows are encoded nearest-to-resolution first (340.4 -- only the top resolves
# next), so anything dropped is the part that matters least, and `n_chain` stays
# in the globals to tell the net that more is stacked than it can see.
CHAIN_SLOTS = 12

# **The** zone list. `nets.py` reads this through `Encoder.shapes()["zones"]`
# rather than keeping its own copy, because it kept one and it went stale: the
# `legends` zone was added in a8a7bf4 and the net's hardcoded four-tuple was
# never updated, so for every run since, the encoder built the Legend Zone and
# the trunk silently discarded it -- including `CX_READY`, which is whether the
# seat's "Exhaust:" ability is still available this turn. Nothing failed; the
# information simply was not there. One definition, so a new zone cannot be
# added to the observation and dropped from the network again.
# Distinct cards per deck, one row each. **Derived from the real decklists**,
# not chosen: measured over `deck_pool_deal`, a real 40-card list runs 14-22
# distinct cards (mean 16.5, p95 20) because constructed decks play 3-ofs.
# 32 is that with headroom.
#
# Unlike `hand` and `board`, overflow here must NOT assert -- not because it is
# expected, but because the dealers are not all equally realistic. `v1_deal`
# used to average 36.5 distinct cards: it sampled a large pool one card at a
# time and only rejected a 4th copy, so repeats were accidents and its decks
# were nearly singleton. It now picks distinct cards and assigns copy counts
# from the measured distribution (17.4 distinct, `ppo.COPY_WEIGHTS`), and
# `test_ppo` [8] holds it there. Rows are still ordered by copy count
# descending, so anything that does overflow is the thinnest part of the least
# realistic deck, and `n_deck_rows` in the globals tells the net how much it is
# not seeing.

#
# The lesson is not "add 24 fields". It is that the engine grows and the encoder
# does not follow, silently, and no test noticed for months. So this set is the

        """Live permanents, with Might decomposed by PERSISTENCE.

        The card block carries PRINTED Might, and for a long time that was the
        only Might in the observation -- so a unit's true Might was wrong on
        8.5% of board rows in real games, by anything from -5 to +7. The policy
        could see `CX_DMG`, the damage marked on a unit, but not the number
        that damage has to reach to kill it. That is the single most important
        quantity in a combat.

        Encoding only "current Might" alongside it would fix the arithmetic and
        still lose the planning, because `combat.might` sums four things that
        disappear on four different schedules:

          P_MIGHT_MOD        "this turn" -- gone in the end-of-turn cleanup
          Buff counter       a counter (703); survives cleanup, gone when the
                             unit leaves play (705)
          static_might       continuous; gone when its SOURCE leaves, and where
                             an Equipment's Might Bonus will land
          combat_role_bonus  [Assault]/[Shield]; exists only inside a Combat
                             (807.1.c, 814.1.c)

        So three columns rather than one, and printed Might already in the row:

          CX_MIGHT          what it is now -- decides this combat
          CX_MIGHT_MOD      the part that evaporates at end of turn
          CX_MIGHT_COMBAT   the part that evaporates when the Combat ends

        which lets the net recover "what this unit resets to" by subtraction,
        and tells apart a real 5-Might body from a 2-Might body wearing a pump
        -- indistinguishable to any pair of (printed, current) numbers, because
        neither says which part decays.

        One inexactness, deliberately left: 143.2.b floors Might at 0, so on a
        unit modified below zero the parts no longer sum to `CX_MIGHT`. Encoding
        the unfloored total instead would misstate the number that actually
        decides lethality, which is the more expensive of the two errors.

        an aggressive list or a grindy one, and "play to your deck's plan" was
        not a behaviour it could express. It saw four cards in hand and the
        number 31.

        **Three grades of knowledge, and the rules fix which applies.**

        Your own list you always know. Against an opponent, 103.1.a puts their
        Champion Legend in the Legend Zone at the start of the game and
        355.10.a.1 makes that zone Public, while 103.1.b.2 has the Legend fix
        the deck's entire Domain Identity -- so you always know the *shape* of
        their deck before a card is drawn, and at competitive level a Legend
        implies most of a list. On top of that, cards of theirs that have been
        seen in public zones are known individually. Only the full registered
        40 is conditional, and `state.deck_known` carries it: true in a match
        after game 1, false against a stranger.

        So each row is a distinct card with three numbers rather than one:

          CX_COPIES   how many are in the registered list  (known lists only)
          CX_SEEN     how many are already sitting in public zones
          CX_KNOWN    whether CX_COPIES means anything at all

        `CX_COPIES - CX_SEEN` is then "how many could still be hidden", which is
        the quantity a player actually counts, and the net can form it. With an
        unknown list only `CX_SEEN` is filled, and the row is a sighting.

        **This is also where the trash finally arrives.** A trash is Public
        (108.5) and is the single richest evidence for what remains in an
        opponent's deck, but the observation carried it as `n_trash / 20` --
        one scalar, contents discarded. Folding it in here rather than giving
        it a zone of its own is the honest framing: a card in their trash is
        not interesting as a trash card, it is interesting as a card you now
        know their deck contained and no longer holds.

        **Read as a multiset, never in order.** `state.decklist` is stored in
        registration order and the live `deck` is in draw order; either read
        positionally would leak the shuffle. Counting copies per distinct card

        **Found by measurement, not by reading.** Perturbing a field and
        re-encoding says definitively whether the policy can see it -- the same
        trick as `test_env`'s leak test, inverted. 24 fields survived that probe
        invisible, every one of them something a player at the table tracks.

        The distinction that matters: state which gates LEGALITY is already
        visible, because the action rows carry what is on offer and the agent
        reads the consequence from an action's absence. What is not visible is
        state that changes **what a position is worth** without changing what
        can be done in it right now. `victory_bonus` is the pure case -- it
        moves the finish line and touches no legal action.

        Two encoding rules:
          * a `*_ply` field holds a ply stamp, so what matters is `== state.ply`
            ("is this live right now"), never the raw number. A stamp keyed on
            anything else covered the opponent's turn too, which is the bug
            [[riftbound-turn-is-a-round-ply-is-a-turn]] records.
          * counters are scaled by roughly what a card counts TO, not by a

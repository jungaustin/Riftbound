"""Real decklists -> playable decks, with every approximation made visible.

The engine implements 17 spells and no unit text, so most real decks contain
cards it cannot fully play. There are three honest options and only one of them
is usable:

  drop them      the deck shrinks below 39 and stops being the same deck
  refuse         nothing is evaluable until the pool is complete
  **approximate** keep the size and shape, and report exactly what was faked

A deck is faked in **two different ways**, and conflating them is what made the
old coverage number wrong:

  substituted    the card is gone, replaced by a different card. Spells with no
                 DSL spec and all Gear -- the engine has nothing to resolve.
  approximated   the card is present with the right cost, domain and body, but
                 printed text or keywords the engine never reads. Every unit
                 with rules text is in here.

`coverage` counts only cards played **as printed**, so it now excludes the
second category. It previously did not: `v1_legal` accepted any card whose
keywords were in the v1 scope target and whose text ran under 90 characters,
which counted 317 of 327 unit slots as covered while executing none of their
text. Reported coverage fell from ~54% to the low 30s when this was fixed --
the decks did not get worse, the number got honest.

**A deck at 50% coverage is a proxy, not that deck**, and any evaluation of it
is a statement about the proxy. That caveat has to travel with the number,
which is why `DeckLoad` carries all three counts rather than a bare list of
card ids.
